# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Logistic-Regression
I have used Logistic Regression to classify this model. Here 2 represents benign(don't have cancer) and 4 represents malignant(do hav cancer).
I have used total of 9 columns Excluding Sample code number column as it is not related to any other column.
I have used sklearn library for data preprocessing and training the model.
I have Evaluated the model with Confusion matrix, classification Report and K-Fold cross validation.
Model gives an accuracy of 96% with Standard Deviation 1.36%
